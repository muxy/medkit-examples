Hello World
-------------
Make sure to add your extension to the [Dev Portal](https://dev.muxy.io)

In the viewer.html and live.html files find the string called 'replaceme' and replace it with your extension client ID.

### Notes
Make sure you have privacy badger disabled. It will block the SDK and SDK requests.
